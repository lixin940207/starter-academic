My name is Xin LI, I graduated from Telecom Paristech in 2019 with a master degree in Data Science. I have worked as a Data Optimization intern at Total for 6 months and as an Algorithm Engineer at DataGrand(a leading AI text processing company in China) for 2 years. My interests are in software developping, data science, natrual language processing and big data technologies.

Back in my previous job, I used to do nlp deep learning research work and then integrate algorithms into production to meet clients' text processing needs, such as information intrival and text classification. Besides that, I also worked for the development team, which develops the whole text processing web system. The main working language was Python, I am also skilled in Flask, redis, database optimization, asychronous, multiprocessing etc.
